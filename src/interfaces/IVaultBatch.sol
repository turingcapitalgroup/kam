/// @notice Interface for batch lifecycle management enabling gas-efficient settlement of multiple user operations
/// @dev This interface defines the batch processing system that aggregates individual staking/unstaking requests
/// for efficient settlement. The batch lifecycle consists of three distinct phases: (1) Open Phase: New requests
/// can be added to the current batch, enabling users to join the settlement period, (2) Closed Phase: No new
/// requests accepted, batch is prepared for settlement with final share price calculations, (3) Settled Phase:
/// Assets distributed and share prices fixed, users can claim their rewards/redemptions. This system provides
/// several key benefits: gas cost optimization through bulk processing, fair pricing through synchronized settlement,
/// coordination with kAssetRouter for cross-vault yield distribution, and minimal proxy deployment for isolated
/// asset distribution. The batch system is critical for maintaining protocol scalability while ensuring equitable
/// treatment of all participants within each settlement period.

    /// (1) Increments internal batch counter for unique identification, (2) Generates deterministic batch ID using
    /// chain-specific parameters (vault address, batch number, chainid, timestamp, asset) for collision resistance,
    /// (3) Initializes batch storage with open state enabling new request acceptance, (4) Updates vault's current
    /// batch tracking for request routing. Only relayers can call this function as part of the automated settlement
    /// schedule. The timing is typically coordinated with institutional settlement cycles to optimize capital
    /// efficiency
    /// across the protocol. Each batch remains open until explicitly closed by relayers or governance.

    /// Process: (1) Validates batch exists and is currently open to prevent double-closing, (2) Marks batch as closed
    /// preventing new stake/unstake requests from joining, (3) Optionally creates new batch for continued operations

    /// of the coordinated settlement schedule across all protocol vaults. The timing typically aligns with DN vault
    /// yield calculations to ensure accurate price discovery.

    /// Process: (1) Validates batch is closed and not already settled to prevent duplicate processing, (2) Snapshots both
    /// gross and net share prices at settlement time for accurate reward calculations, (3) Mints stkTokens for all pending
    /// stakers in this batch to the vault itself at the settlement share price (clearing totalPendingStake for this batch),
    /// (4) Marks batch as settled enabling users to claim their staked shares or unstaked assets, (5) Completes the batch
    /// lifecycle allowing reward distribution through the claiming mechanism. Only kAssetRouter can settle batches as it
    /// coordinates yield calculations across DN vaults and manages cross-vault asset flows. The pre-minting approach ensures
    /// share prices are locked at settlement and users receive shares via transfer (not mint) when they claim.
