/// @notice ERC20 representation of underlying assets with guaranteed 1:1 backing in the KAM protocol
/// @dev This contract serves as the tokenized wrapper for protocol-supported underlying assets (USDC, WBTC, etc.).
/// Each kToken maintains a strict 1:1 relationship with its underlying asset through controlled minting and burning.
/// Key characteristics: (1) Authorized minters (kMinter for institutional deposits, kAssetRouter for yield
/// distribution)
/// can create/destroy tokens, (2) kMinter mints tokens 1:1 when assets are deposited and burns during redemptions,
/// (3) kAssetRouter mints tokens to distribute positive yield to vaults and burns tokens for negative yield/losses,
/// (4) Implements three-tier role system: ADMIN_ROLE for management, EMERGENCY_ADMIN_ROLE for emergency operations,
/// MINTER_ROLE for token creation/destruction, (5) Features emergency pause mechanism to halt all transfers during
/// protocol emergencies, (6) Supports emergency asset recovery for accidentally sent tokens. The contract ensures
/// protocol integrity by maintaining that kToken supply accurately reflects the underlying asset backing plus any
/// distributed yield, while enabling efficient yield distribution without physical asset transfers.
