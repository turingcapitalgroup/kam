/// @title kBatchReceiver
/// @notice Minimal proxy contract implementation for isolated batch asset distribution in the KAM protocol
/// @dev This contract implements the minimal proxy pattern where each batch redemption gets its own dedicated
/// receiver instance for secure and efficient asset distribution. The implementation provides several key features:
/// (1) Minimal Proxy Pattern: Uses EIP-1167 minimal proxy deployment to reduce gas costs per batch while maintaining
/// full isolation between different settlement periods, (2) Batch Isolation: Each receiver handles exactly one batch,
/// preventing cross-contamination and simplifying accounting, (3) Access Control: Only the originating kMinter can
/// interact with receivers, ensuring strict security throughout the distribution process, (4) Asset Distribution:
/// Manages the final step of redemption where settled assets flow from kMinter to individual users, (5) Emergency
/// Recovery: Provides safety mechanisms for accidentally sent tokens while protecting settlement assets.
///
/// Technical Implementation Notes:
/// - Uses immutable kMinter reference set at construction for gas efficiency
/// - Implements strict batch ID validation to prevent operational errors
/// - Supports both ERC20 and native ETH rescue operations
/// - Emits comprehensive events for off-chain tracking and reconciliation
