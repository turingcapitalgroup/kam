# Proxy
[Git Source](https://github.com/VerisLabs/KAM/blob/6a1b6d509ce3835558278e8d1f43531aed3b9112/src/vendor/openzeppelin/Proxy.sol)

This abstract contract provides a fallback function that delegates all calls to another contract using the EVM
instruction `delegatecall`. We refer to the second contract as the _implementation_ behind the proxy, and it has to
be specified by overriding the virtual [_implementation](//Users/filipe.venancio/Documents/GitHub/KAM/foundry-docs/src/src/vendor/openzeppelin/Proxy.sol/abstract.Proxy.md#_implementation) function.
Additionally, delegation to the implementation can be triggered manually through the [_fallback](//Users/filipe.venancio/Documents/GitHub/KAM/foundry-docs/src/src/vendor/openzeppelin/Proxy.sol/abstract.Proxy.md#_fallback) function, or to a
different contract through the [_delegate](//Users/filipe.venancio/Documents/GitHub/KAM/foundry-docs/src/src/vendor/openzeppelin/Proxy.sol/abstract.Proxy.md#_delegate) function.
The success and return data of the delegated call will be returned back to the caller of the proxy.


## Functions
### _delegate

Delegates the current call to `implementation`.
This function does not return to its internal call site, it will return directly to the external caller.


```solidity
function _delegate(address implementation) internal virtual;
```

### _implementation

This is a virtual function that should be overridden so it returns the address to which the fallback
function and [_fallback](//Users/filipe.venancio/Documents/GitHub/KAM/foundry-docs/src/src/vendor/openzeppelin/Proxy.sol/abstract.Proxy.md#_fallback) should delegate.


```solidity
function _implementation() internal view virtual returns (address);
```

### _fallback

Delegates the current call to the address returned by `_implementation()`.
This function does not return to its internal call site, it will return directly to the external caller.


```solidity
function _fallback() internal virtual;
```

### fallback

Fallback function that delegates calls to the address returned by `_implementation()`. Will run if no other
function in the contract matches the call data.


```solidity
fallback() external payable virtual;
```
