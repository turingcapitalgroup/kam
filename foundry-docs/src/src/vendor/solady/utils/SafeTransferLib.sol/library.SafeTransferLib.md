**Authors:**

Safe ETH and ERC20 transfer library that gracefully handles missing return values.

Note:
- For ETH transfers, please use `forceSafeTransferETH` for DoS protection.


## State Variables
### GAS_STIPEND_NO_STORAGE_WRITES
Suggested gas stipend for contract receiving ETH that disallows any storage writes.


```solidity
uint256 internal constant GAS_STIPEND_NO_STORAGE_WRITES = 2300
```


### GAS_STIPEND_NO_GRIEF
Suggested gas stipend for contract receiving ETH to perform a few
storage reads and writes, but low enough to prevent griefing.


```solidity
uint256 internal constant GAS_STIPEND_NO_GRIEF = 100_000
```


### DAI_DOMAIN_SEPARATOR
The unique EIP-712 domain separator for the DAI token contract.

### PERMIT2

## Functions
### safeTransferETH

Sends `amount` (in wei) ETH to `to`.


```solidity
function safeTransferETH(address to, uint256 amount) internal;
```

### safeTransferAllETH

Sends all the ETH in the current contract to `to`.


```solidity
function safeTransferAllETH(address to) internal;
```

### forceSafeTransferETH

Force sends `amount` (in wei) ETH to `to`, with a `gasStipend`.


```solidity
function forceSafeTransferETH(address to, uint256 amount, uint256 gasStipend) internal;
```

### forceSafeTransferAllETH

Force sends all the ETH in the current contract to `to`, with a `gasStipend`.


```solidity
function forceSafeTransferAllETH(address to, uint256 gasStipend) internal;
```

### forceSafeTransferETH

Force sends `amount` (in wei) ETH to `to`, with `GAS_STIPEND_NO_GRIEF`.


```solidity
function forceSafeTransferETH(address to, uint256 amount) internal;
```

### forceSafeTransferAllETH

Force sends all the ETH in the current contract to `to`, with `GAS_STIPEND_NO_GRIEF`.


```solidity
function forceSafeTransferAllETH(address to) internal;
```

### trySafeTransferETH

Sends `amount` (in wei) ETH to `to`, with a `gasStipend`.


```solidity
function trySafeTransferETH(address to, uint256 amount, uint256 gasStipend) internal returns (bool success);
```

### trySafeTransferAllETH

Sends all the ETH in the current contract to `to`, with a `gasStipend`.


```solidity
function trySafeTransferAllETH(address to, uint256 gasStipend) internal returns (bool success);
```

### safeTransferFrom

Sends `amount` of ERC20 `token` from `from` to `to`.
Reverts upon failure.
The `from` account must have at least `amount` approved for
the current contract to manage.


```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address token, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal;
```

### trySafeTransferFrom

Sends `amount` of ERC20 `token` from `from` to `to`.
The `from` account must have at least `amount` approved for the current contract to manage.


```solidity
function trySafeTransferFrom(
    address token,
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
)
    internal
    returns (bool success);
```

### safeTransferAllFrom

Sends all of ERC20 `token` from `from` to `to`.
Reverts upon failure.
The `from` account must have their entire balance approved for the current contract to manage.


```solidity
function safeTransferAllFrom(address token, address from, address to) internal returns (uint256 amount);
```

### safeTransfer

Sends `amount` of ERC20 `token` from the current contract to `to`.
Reverts upon failure.


```solidity
function safeTransfer(address token, address to, uint256 amount) internal;
```

### safeTransferAll

Sends all of ERC20 `token` from the current contract to `to`.
Reverts upon failure.


```solidity
function safeTransferAll(address token, address to) internal returns (uint256 amount);
```

### safeApprove

Sets `amount` of ERC20 `token` for `to` to manage on behalf of the current contract.
Reverts upon failure.


```solidity
function safeApprove(address token, address to, uint256 amount) internal;
```

### safeApproveWithRetry

Sets `amount` of ERC20 `token` for `to` to manage on behalf of the current contract.
If the initial attempt to approve fails, attempts to reset the approved amount to zero,
then retries the approval again (some tokens, e.g. USDT, requires this).
Reverts upon failure.


```solidity
function safeApproveWithRetry(address token, address to, uint256 amount) internal;
```

### balanceOf

Returns the amount of ERC20 `token` owned by `account`.
Returns zero if the `token` does not exist.


```solidity
function balanceOf(address token, address account) internal view returns (uint256 amount);
```

### checkBalanceOf

Performs a `token.balanceOf(account)` check.
`implemented` denotes whether the `token` does not implement `balanceOf`.
`amount` is zero if the `token` does not implement `balanceOf`.


```solidity
function checkBalanceOf(
    address token,
    address account
)
    internal
    view
    returns (bool implemented, uint256 amount);
```

### totalSupply

Returns the total supply of the `token`.
Reverts if the token does not exist or does not implement `totalSupply()`.


```solidity
function totalSupply(address token) internal view returns (uint256 result);
```

### safeTransferFrom2

Sends `amount` of ERC20 `token` from `from` to `to`.
If the initial attempt fails, try to use Permit2 to transfer the token.
Reverts upon failure.
The `from` account must have at least `amount` approved for the current contract to manage.


```solidity
function safeTransferFrom2(address token, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal;
```

### permit2TransferFrom

Sends `amount` of ERC20 `token` from `from` to `to` via Permit2.
Reverts upon failure.


```solidity
function permit2TransferFrom(address token, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal;
```

### permit2

Permit a user to spend a given amount of
another user's tokens via native EIP-2612 permit if possible, falling
back to Permit2 if native permit fails or is not implemented on the token.


```solidity
function permit2(
    address token,
    address owner,
    address spender,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 deadline,
    uint8 v,
    bytes32 r,
    bytes32 s
)
    internal;
```

### simplePermit2

Simple permit on the Permit2 contract.


```solidity
function simplePermit2(
    address token,
    address owner,
    address spender,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 deadline,
    uint8 v,
    bytes32 r,
    bytes32 s
)
    internal;
```

### permit2Approve

Approves `spender` to spend `amount` of `token` for `address(this)`.


```solidity
function permit2Approve(address token, address spender, uint160 amount, uint48 expiration) internal;
```

### permit2Lockdown

Revokes an approval for `token` and `spender` for `address(this)`.


```solidity
function permit2Lockdown(address token, address spender) internal;
```
