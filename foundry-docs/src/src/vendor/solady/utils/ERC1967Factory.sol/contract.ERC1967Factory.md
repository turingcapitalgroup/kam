```


## Functions
### adminOf

Returns the admin of the proxy.


```solidity
function adminOf(address proxy) public view returns (address admin);
```

### changeAdmin

Sets the admin of the proxy.
The caller of this function must be the admin of the proxy on this factory.


```solidity
function changeAdmin(address proxy, address admin) public;
```

### upgrade

Upgrades the proxy to point to `implementation`.
The caller of this function must be the admin of the proxy on this factory.


```solidity
function upgrade(address proxy, address implementation) public payable;
```

### upgradeAndCall

Upgrades the proxy to point to `implementation`.
Then, calls the proxy with abi encoded `data`.
The caller of this function must be the admin of the proxy on this factory.


```solidity
function upgradeAndCall(address proxy, address implementation, bytes calldata data) public payable;
```

### deploy

Deploys a proxy for `implementation`, with `admin`,
and returns its address.
The value passed into this function will be forwarded to the proxy.


```solidity
function deploy(address implementation, address admin) public payable returns (address proxy);
```

### deployAndCall

Deploys a proxy for `implementation`, with `admin`,
and returns its address.
The value passed into this function will be forwarded to the proxy.
Then, calls the proxy with abi encoded `data`.


```solidity
function deployAndCall(
    address implementation,
    address admin,
    bytes calldata data
)
    public
    payable
    returns (address proxy);
```

### deployDeterministic

Deploys a proxy for `implementation`, with `admin`, `salt`,
and returns its deterministic address.
The value passed into this function will be forwarded to the proxy.


```solidity
function deployDeterministic(
    address implementation,
    address admin,
    bytes32 salt
)
    public
    payable
    returns (address proxy);
```

### deployDeterministicAndCall

Deploys a proxy for `implementation`, with `admin`, `salt`,
and returns its deterministic address.
The value passed into this function will be forwarded to the proxy.
Then, calls the proxy with abi encoded `data`.


```solidity
function deployDeterministicAndCall(
    address implementation,
    address admin,
    bytes32 salt,
    bytes calldata data
)
    public
    payable
    returns (address proxy);
```

### _deploy

Deploys the proxy, with optionality to deploy deterministically with a `salt`.


```solidity
function _deploy(
    address implementation,
    address admin,
    bytes32 salt,
    bool useSalt,
    bytes calldata data
)
    internal
    returns (address proxy);
```

### predictDeterministicAddress

Returns the address of the proxy deployed with `salt`.


```solidity
function predictDeterministicAddress(bytes32 salt) public view returns (address predicted);
```

### initCodeHash

Returns the initialization code hash of the proxy.
Used for mining vanity addresses with create2crunch.


```solidity
function initCodeHash() public view returns (bytes32 result);
```

### _initCode

Returns a pointer to the initialization code of a proxy created via this factory.


```solidity
function _initCode() internal view returns (bytes32 m);
```

### _emptyData

Helper function to return an empty bytes calldata.


```solidity
function _emptyData() internal pure returns (bytes calldata data);
```

## Events
### AdminChanged
The admin of a proxy contract has been changed.


```solidity
event AdminChanged(address indexed proxy, address indexed admin);
```

### Upgraded
The implementation for a proxy has been upgraded.


```solidity
event Upgraded(address indexed proxy, address indexed implementation);
```

### Deployed
A proxy has been deployed.


```solidity
event Deployed(address indexed proxy, address indexed implementation, address indexed admin);
```

## Errors
### Unauthorized
The caller is not authorized to call the function.


```solidity
error Unauthorized();
```

### DeploymentFailed
The proxy deployment failed.


```solidity
error DeploymentFailed();
```

### UpgradeFailed
The upgrade failed.


```solidity
error UpgradeFailed();
```

### SaltDoesNotStartWithCaller
The salt does not start with the caller.


```solidity
error SaltDoesNotStartWithCaller();
```
