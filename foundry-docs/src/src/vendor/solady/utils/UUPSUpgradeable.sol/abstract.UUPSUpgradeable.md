UUPS proxy mixin.

Note:
- This implementation is intended to be used with ERC1967 proxies.
See: `OptimizedLibClone.deployERC1967` and related functions.
- This implementation is NOT compatible with legacy OpenZeppelin proxies
which do not store the implementation at `_ERC1967_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT`.


## State Variables
### _UPGRADED_EVENT_SIGNATURE
`keccak256(bytes("Upgraded(address)"))`.


```solidity
uint256 private constant _UPGRADED_EVENT_SIGNATURE =
    0xbc7cd75a20ee27fd9adebab32041f755214dbc6bffa90cc0225b39da2e5c2d3b
```


### _ERC1967_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT
The ERC-1967 storage slot for the implementation in the proxy.
`uint256(keccak256("eip1967.proxy.implementation")) - 1`.


```solidity
bytes32 internal constant _ERC1967_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT =
    0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc
```


## Functions
### _authorizeUpgrade

Please override this function to check if `msg.sender` is authorized
to upgrade the proxy to `newImplementation`, reverting if not.
```
function _authorizeUpgrade(address) internal override onlyOwner {}
```


```solidity
function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal virtual;
```

### proxiableUUID

Returns the storage slot used by the implementation,
as specified in [ERC1822](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1822).
Note: The `notDelegated` modifier prevents accidental upgrades to
an implementation that is a proxy contract.


```solidity
function proxiableUUID() public view virtual notDelegated returns (bytes32);
```

### upgradeToAndCall

Upgrades the proxy's implementation to `newImplementation`.
Emits a [Upgraded](//Users/filipe.venancio/Documents/GitHub/KAM/foundry-docs/src/src/vendor/solady/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol/abstract.UUPSUpgradeable.md#upgraded) event.
Note: Passing in empty `data` skips the delegatecall to `newImplementation`.


```solidity
function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes calldata data) public payable virtual onlyProxy;
```

## Events
### Upgraded
Emitted when the proxy's implementation is upgraded.


```solidity
event Upgraded(address indexed implementation);
```

## Errors
### UpgradeFailed
The upgrade failed.


```solidity
error UpgradeFailed();
```
