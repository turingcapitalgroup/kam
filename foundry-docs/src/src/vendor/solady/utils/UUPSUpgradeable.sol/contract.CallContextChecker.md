Call context checker mixin.


## State Variables
### __self
For checking if the context is a delegate call.
Note: To enable use cases with an immutable default implementation in the bytecode,
(see: ERC6551Proxy), we don't require that the proxy address must match the
value stored in the implementation slot, which may not be initialized.


```solidity
uint256 private immutable __self = uint256(uint160(address(this)))
```


## Functions
### _onEIP7702Authority

Returns whether the current call context is on a EIP7702 authority
(i.e. externally owned account).


```solidity
function _onEIP7702Authority() internal view virtual returns (bool result);
```

### _selfImplementation

Returns the implementation of this contract.


```solidity
function _selfImplementation() internal view virtual returns (address);
```

### _onImplementation

Returns whether the current call context is on the implementation itself.


```solidity
function _onImplementation() internal view virtual returns (bool);
```

### _checkOnlyEIP7702Authority

Requires that the current call context is performed via a EIP7702 authority.


```solidity
function _checkOnlyEIP7702Authority() internal view virtual;
```

### _checkOnlyProxy

Requires that the current call context is performed via a proxy.


```solidity
function _checkOnlyProxy() internal view virtual;
```

### _checkNotDelegated

Requires that the current call context is NOT performed via a proxy.
This is the opposite of `checkOnlyProxy`.


```solidity
function _checkNotDelegated() internal view virtual;
```

### onlyEIP7702Authority

Requires that the current call context is performed via a EIP7702 authority.


```solidity
modifier onlyEIP7702Authority() virtual;
```

### onlyProxy

Requires that the current call context is performed via a proxy.


```solidity
modifier onlyProxy() virtual;
```

### notDelegated

Requires that the current call context is NOT performed via a proxy.
This is the opposite of `onlyProxy`.


```solidity
modifier notDelegated() virtual;
```

### _revertUnauthorizedCallContext


```solidity
function _revertUnauthorizedCallContext() private pure;
```

## Errors
### UnauthorizedCallContext
The call is from an unauthorized call context.


```solidity
error UnauthorizedCallContext();
```
