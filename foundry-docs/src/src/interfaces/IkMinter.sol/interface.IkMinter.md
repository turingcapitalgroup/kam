Interface for institutional minting and redemption operations in the KAM protocol

This interface defines the core functionality for qualified institutions to mint kTokens
by depositing underlying assets and burn them through a batch settlement system. The interface
supports a two-phase redemption process to accommodate batch processing and yield distribution.


## Functions
### mint

Executes institutional minting of kTokens through immediate 1:1 issuance against deposited assets

This function enables qualified institutions to mint kTokens by depositing underlying assets. The process
involves: (1) transferring assets from the caller to kAssetRouter, (2) pushing assets into the current batch
of the designated DN vault for yield generation, and (3) immediately minting an equivalent amount of kTokens
to the recipient. Unlike retail operations, institutional mints bypass share-based accounting and provide
immediate token issuance without waiting for batch settlement. The deposited assets are tracked separately
to maintain the 1:1 backing ratio and will participate in vault yield strategies through the batch system.


```solidity
function mint(address asset, address to, uint256 amount) external payable;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`asset`|`address`|The underlying asset address to deposit (must be registered in the protocol)|
|`to`|`address`|The recipient address that will receive the newly minted kTokens|
|`amount`|`uint256`|The amount of underlying asset to deposit and kTokens to mint (1:1 ratio)|


### requestBurn

Initiates a two-phase institutional redemption by creating a batch request for underlying asset
withdrawal

This function implements the first phase of the redemption process for qualified institutions. The workflow
consists of: (1) transferring kTokens from the caller to this contract for escrow (not burned yet), (2)
generating
a unique request ID for tracking, (3) creating a BurnRequest struct with PENDING status, (4) registering the
request with kAssetRouter for batch processing. The kTokens remain in escrow until the batch is settled and the
user calls burn() to complete the process. This two-phase approach is necessary because redemptions are
processed
in batches through the DN vault system, which requires waiting for batch settlement to ensure proper asset
availability and yield distribution. The request can be cancelled before batch closure/settlement.


```solidity
function requestBurn(address asset, address to, uint256 amount) external payable returns (bytes32 requestId);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`asset`|`address`|The underlying asset address to burn (must match the kToken's underlying asset)|
|`to`|`address`|The recipient address that will receive the underlying assets after batch settlement|
|`amount`|`uint256`|The amount of kTokens to burn (will receive equivalent underlying assets)|

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`requestId`|`bytes32`|A unique bytes32 identifier for tracking and executing this redemption request|


### burn

Completes the second phase of institutional redemption by executing a settled batch request

This function finalizes the redemption process initiated by requestBurn(). It can only be called after
the batch containing this request has been settled through the kAssetRouter settlement process. The execution
involves: (1) validating the request exists and is in PENDING status, (2) updating the request status to
REDEEMED,
(3) removing the request from tracking, (4) burning the escrowed kTokens permanently, (5) instructing the
kBatchReceiver contract to transfer the underlying assets to the recipient. The kBatchReceiver is a minimal
proxy
deployed per batch that holds the settled assets and ensures isolated distribution. This function will revert if
the batch is not yet settled, ensuring assets are only distributed when available. The separation between
request
and redemption phases allows for efficient batch processing of multiple redemptions while maintaining asset
safety.

### rescueReceiverAssets

Emergency admin function to recover stuck assets from a batch receiver contract

This function provides a recovery mechanism for assets that may become stuck in kBatchReceiver contracts
due to failed redemptions or system errors. The process involves two steps: (1) calling rescueAssets on the
kBatchReceiver to transfer assets back to this contract, and (2) using the inherited rescueAssets function
from kBase to forward them to the specified destination. This two-step process ensures proper access control
and maintains the security model where only authorized contracts can interact with batch receivers. This
function should only be used in emergency situations and requires admin privileges to prevent abuse.
