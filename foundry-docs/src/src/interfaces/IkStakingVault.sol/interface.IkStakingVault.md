[IVault](/Users/filipe.venancio/Documents/GitHub/KAM/foundry-docs/src/src/interfaces/IVault.sol/interface.IVault.md), [IVaultReader](/Users/filipe.venancio/Documents/GitHub/KAM/foundry-docs/src/src/interfaces/modules/IVaultReader.sol/interface.IVaultReader.md)

Comprehensive interface combining retail staking operations with ERC20 share tokens and vault state reading

This interface aggregates all kStakingVault functionality by extending IVault (staking/batch/claims/fees) and
IVaultReader (state queries) while adding standard ERC20 operations for stkToken management. The interface provides
a complete view of vault capabilities: (1) Staking Operations: Full request/claim lifecycle for retail users,
(2) Batch Management: Lifecycle control for settlement periods, (3) Share Tokens: Standard ERC20 functionality for
stkTokens that accrue yield, (4) State Reading: Comprehensive vault metrics and calculations, (5) Fee Management:
Performance and management fee configuration. This unified interface enables complete vault interaction through a
single contract, simplifying integration for front-ends and external protocols while maintaining modularity through
interface composition. The combination of vault-specific operations with standard ERC20 compatibility ensures
stkTokens work seamlessly with existing DeFi infrastructure while providing specialized staking functionality.
