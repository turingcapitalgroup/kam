Central money flow coordinator for the KAM protocol managing all asset movements and settlements

This interface defines the core functionality for kAssetRouter, which serves as the primary coordinator
for all asset movements within the KAM protocol ecosystem. Key responsibilities include: (1) Managing asset
flows from kMinter institutional deposits to DN vaults for yield generation, (2) Coordinating asset transfers
between kStakingVaults for optimal allocation, (3) Processing batch settlements with yield distribution through
kToken minting/burning, (4) Maintaining virtual balance tracking across all vaults, (5) Implementing settlement
cooldown periods for security, (6) Executing peg protection mechanisms during market stress. The router acts as
the central hub that enables efficient capital allocation while maintaining the 1:1 backing guarantee of kTokens
through precise yield distribution and loss management across the protocol's vault network.


## Functions
### kAssetPush

Pushes assets from kMinter institutional deposits to the designated DN vault for yield generation

This function is called by kMinter when institutional users deposit underlying assets. The process
involves: (1) receiving assets already transferred from kMinter, (2) forwarding them to the appropriate
DN vault for the asset type, (3) updating virtual balance tracking for accurate accounting. This enables
immediate kToken minting (1:1 with deposits) while assets begin generating yield in the vault system.
The assets enter the current batch for eventual settlement and yield distribution back to kToken holders.


```solidity
function kAssetPush(address _asset, uint256 amount, bytes32 batchId) external payable;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_asset`|`address`|The underlying asset address being deposited (must be registered in protocol)|
|`amount`|`uint256`|The quantity of assets being pushed to the vault for yield generation|
|`batchId`|`bytes32`|The current batch identifier from the DN vault for tracking and settlement|


### kAssetRequestPull

Requests asset withdrawal from vault to fulfill institutional redemption through kMinter

This function initiates the first phase of the institutional redemption process. The workflow
involves: (1) registering the redemption request with the vault, (2) creating a kBatchReceiver minimal
proxy to hold assets for distribution, (3) updating virtual balance accounting, (4) preparing for
batch settlement. The actual asset transfer occurs later during batch settlement when the vault
processes all pending requests together. This two-phase approach optimizes gas costs and ensures
fair settlement across all institutional redemption requests in the batch.


```solidity
function kAssetRequestPull(address _asset, uint256 amount, bytes32 batchId) external payable;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_asset`|`address`|The underlying asset address being redeemed|
|`amount`|`uint256`|The quantity of assets requested for redemption|
|`batchId`|`bytes32`|The batch identifier for coordinating this redemption with other requests|


### kAssetTransfer

Transfers assets between kStakingVaults for optimal capital allocation and yield optimization

This function enables dynamic rebalancing of assets across the vault network to optimize yields
and manage capacity. The transfer is virtual in nature - actual underlying assets may remain in the
same physical vault while accounting balances are updated. This mechanism allows for: (1) moving
assets from lower-yield to higher-yield opportunities, (2) rebalancing vault capacity during high
demand periods, (3) optimizing capital efficiency across the protocol. The batch system ensures
all transfers are processed fairly during settlement periods.


```solidity
function kAssetTransfer(
    address sourceVault,
    address targetVault,
    address _asset,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes32 batchId
)
    external
    payable;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`sourceVault`|`address`|The kStakingVault address transferring assets (will lose virtual balance)|
|`targetVault`|`address`|The kStakingVault address receiving assets (will gain virtual balance)|
|`_asset`|`address`|The underlying asset address being transferred between vaults|
|`amount`|`uint256`|The quantity of assets to transfer for rebalancing|
|`batchId`|`bytes32`|The batch identifier for coordinating this transfer with settlement|


### kSharesRequestPush

Requests shares to be pushed for kStakingVault staking operations and batch processing

This function is part of the share-based accounting system for retail users in kStakingVaults.
When users stake kTokens, the vault requests shares to be pushed to track their ownership. The
process coordinates: (1) conversion of kTokens to vault shares at current share price, (2) updating
user balances in the vault system, (3) preparing for batch settlement. Share requests are batched
to optimize gas costs and ensure fair pricing across all users in the same settlement period.


```solidity
function kSharesRequestPush(address sourceVault, uint256 amount, bytes32 batchId) external payable;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`sourceVault`|`address`|The kStakingVault address requesting share push operations|
|`amount`|`uint256`|The quantity of shares being requested for push to users|
|`batchId`|`bytes32`|The batch identifier for coordinating share operations with settlement|


### kSharesRequestPull

Requests shares to be pulled for kStakingVault redemption operations

This function handles the share-based redemption process for retail users withdrawing from
kStakingVaults. The process involves: (1) calculating share amounts to redeem based on user
requests, (2) preparing for conversion back to kTokens at settlement time, (3) coordinating
with the batch settlement system for fair pricing. Unlike institutional redemptions through
kMinter, this uses share-based accounting to handle smaller, more frequent retail operations
efficiently through the vault's batch processing system.


```solidity
function kSharesRequestPull(address sourceVault, uint256 amount, bytes32 batchId) external payable;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`sourceVault`|`address`|The kStakingVault address requesting share pull for redemptions|
|`amount`|`uint256`|The quantity of shares being requested for pull from users|
|`batchId`|`bytes32`|The batch identifier for coordinating share redemptions with settlement|


### proposeSettleBatch

Proposes a batch settlement for a vault with yield distribution through kToken minting/burning

This is the core function that initiates yield distribution in the KAM protocol. The settlement
process involves: (1) calculating final yields after a batch period, (2) determining net new deposits/
redemptions, (3) creating a proposal with cooldown period for security verification, (4) preparing for
kToken supply adjustment to maintain 1:1 backing. Positive yields result in kToken minting (distributing
gains to all holders), while losses result in kToken burning (socializing losses). The cooldown period
allows guardians to verify calculations before execution, ensuring protocol integrity.


```solidity
function proposeSettleBatch(
    address asset,
    address vault,
    bytes32 batchId,
    uint256 totalAssets,
    uint64 lastFeesChargedManagement,
    uint64 lastFeesChargedPerformance

|`lastFeesChargedManagement`|`uint64`|Last management fees charged|
|`lastFeesChargedPerformance`|`uint64`|Last performance fees charged|


### executeSettleBatch

Executes a settlement proposal after the security cooldown period has elapsed

This function completes the yield distribution process by: (1) verifying the cooldown period has
passed, (2) executing the actual kToken minting/burning to distribute yield or account for losses,
(3) updating all vault balances and user accounting, (4) processing any pending redemption requests
from the batch. This is where the 1:1 backing is maintained - the kToken supply is adjusted to exactly
reflect the underlying asset changes, ensuring every kToken remains backed by real assets plus distributed
yield.


```solidity
function executeSettleBatch(bytes32 proposalId) external payable;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`proposalId`|`bytes32`|The unique identifier of the settlement proposal to execute|


### cancelProposal

Cancels a settlement proposal before execution if errors are detected

Provides a safety mechanism for guardians to cancel potentially incorrect settlement proposals.
This can be used when: (1) yield calculations appear incorrect, (2) system errors are detected,
(3) market conditions require recalculation. Cancellation allows for proposal correction and
resubmission with accurate data, preventing incorrect yield distribution that could affect the
protocol's 1:1 backing guarantee. Only callable before the proposal execution.


```solidity
function cancelProposal(bytes32 proposalId) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`proposalId`|`bytes32`|The unique identifier of the settlement proposal to cancel|


### setSettlementCooldown

The cooldown period provides critical security by requiring a delay between proposal creation
and execution. This allows: (1) protocol guardians to verify yield calculations, (2) detection of
potential errors or malicious proposals, (3) emergency intervention if needed. The cooldown should
balance security (longer is safer) with operational efficiency (shorter enables faster yield
distribution). Only admin roles can modify this parameter as it affects protocol safety.


```solidity
function setSettlementCooldown(uint256 cooldown) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`cooldown`|`uint256`|The new cooldown period in seconds before settlement proposals can be executed|


### setMaxAllowedDelta

Updates the yield tolerance threshold for settlement proposals

This function allows protocol governance to adjust the maximum acceptable yield deviation before
settlement proposals are rejected. The yield tolerance acts as a safety mechanism to prevent settlement
proposals with extremely high or low yield values that could indicate calculation errors, data corruption,
or potential manipulation attempts. Setting an appropriate tolerance balances protocol safety with
operational flexibility, allowing normal yield fluctuations while blocking suspicious proposals.
Only admin roles can modify this parameter as it affects protocol safety.


```solidity
function setMaxAllowedDelta(uint256 tolerance_) external;
```

struct Balances {
    /// @dev Amount of assets requested for redemption by kMinter but not yet processed

### VaultSettlementProposal
Contains all parameters for a batch settlement proposal in the yield distribution system

Settlement proposals implement a cooldown mechanism for security, allowing guardians to verify
yield calculations before execution. Once executed, the proposal triggers kToken minting/burning to
distribute yield or account for losses, maintaining the 1:1 backing ratio across all kTokens.


```solidity
struct VaultSettlementProposal {
    /// @dev The underlying asset address being settled (USDC, WBTC, etc.)
    address asset;
    /// @dev The DN vault address where yield was generated
    address vault;
    /// @dev The batch identifier for this settlement period
    bytes32 batchId;
    /// @dev Total asset value in the vault after yield generation
    uint256 totalAssets;
    /// @dev Net amount of new deposits/redemptions in this batch
    int256 netted;
    /// @dev Absolute yield amount (positive or negative) generated in this batch
    int256 yield;
    /// @dev Timestamp after which this proposal can be executed (cooldown protection)
    uint64 executeAfter;
    /// @dev Timestamp of last management fee charged
    uint64 lastFeesChargedManagement;
    /// @dev Timestamp of last performance fee charged
    uint64 lastFeesChargedPerformance;
}
