Interface for claiming settled staking rewards and unstaking assets after batch processing completion

This interface defines the final phase of the two-phase staking/unstaking system where users collect
their rewards after batch settlement. The claiming mechanism operates after batches have been settled by
kAssetRouter with finalized share prices and yield calculations. Key features include: (1) Share Distribution:
For staking claims, users receive stkTokens at the settled share price reflecting vault performance during
the batch period, (2) Asset Distribution: For unstaking claims, users receive kTokens (including accrued yield)
distributed through batch-specific receiver contracts, (3) Request Validation: Claims are validated against
original requests to ensure only authorized recipients can claim, (4) State Management: Claimed requests are
marked to prevent double-claiming while maintaining audit trails. The two-phase approach (request → claim)
provides several advantages: fair pricing through synchronized settlement, gas efficiency by separating request
processing from asset distribution, security through settled price finalization, and operational flexibility
for users to claim rewards at their convenience after settlement.


## Functions
### claimStakedShares

Claims stkTokens from a settled staking batch at the finalized share price

This function completes the staking process by distributing stkTokens to users after batch settlement.
Process: (1) Validates batch has been settled and share prices are finalized to ensure accurate distribution,
(2) Verifies request ownership and pending status to prevent unauthorized or duplicate claims, (3) Calculates
stkToken amount based on original kToken deposit and settled net share price (after fees), (4) Mints stkTokens
to specified recipient reflecting their proportional vault ownership, (5) Marks request as claimed to prevent
future reprocessing. The net share price accounts for management and performance fees, ensuring users receive
their accurate yield-adjusted position. stkTokens are ERC20-compatible shares that continue accruing yield
through share price appreciation until unstaking.

**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`requestId`|`bytes32`|The specific staking request identifier to claim rewards for|


### claimUnstakedAssets

Claims kTokens plus accrued yield from a settled unstaking batch through batch receiver distribution

This function completes the unstaking process by distributing redeemed assets to users after settlement.
Process: (1) Validates batch settlement and asset distribution readiness through batch receiver verification,
(2) Confirms request ownership and pending status to ensure authorized claiming, (3) Calculates kToken amount
based on original stkToken redemption and settled share price including yield, (4) Burns locked stkTokens
that were held during settlement period, (5) Triggers batch receiver to transfer calculated kTokens to
recipient,
(6) Marks request as claimed completing the unstaking cycle. The batch receiver pattern ensures asset isolation
between settlement periods while enabling efficient distribution. Users receive their original investment plus
proportional share of vault yields earned during their staking period.
