Retail staking vault enabling kToken holders to earn yield through batch-processed share tokens

This contract implements the complete retail staking system for the KAM protocol, providing individual
kToken holders access to institutional-grade yield opportunities through a share-based mechanism. The implementation
combines several architectural patterns: (1) Dual-token system where kTokens convert to yield-bearing stkTokens,
(2) Batch processing for gas-efficient operations and fair pricing across multiple users, (3) Virtual balance
coordination with kAssetRouter for cross-vault yield optimization, (4) Two-phase operations (request → claim)
ensuring accurate settlement and preventing MEV attacks, (5) Fee management system supporting both management
and performance fees with hurdle rate mechanisms. The vault integrates with the broader protocol through
kAssetRouter for asset flow coordination and yield distribution. Gas optimizations include packed storage,
minimal proxy deployment for batch receivers, and efficient batch settlement processing. The modular architecture
enables upgrades while maintaining state integrity through UUPS pattern and ERC-7201 storage.


## Functions
### constructor

Disables initializers to prevent implementation contract initialization


```solidity
constructor() ;
```

### initialize

Initializes the kStakingVault with complete protocol integration and share token configuration

This function establishes the vault's integration with the KAM protocol ecosystem. The initialization
process: (1) Validates asset address to prevent deployment with invalid configuration, (2) Initializes
BaseVault foundation with registry and operational state, (3) Sets up ownership and access control through
Ownable pattern, (4) Configures share token metadata and decimals for ERC20 functionality, (5) Establishes
kToken integration through registry lookup for asset-to-token mapping, (6) Sets initial share price watermark
for performance fee calculations, (7) Deploys BatchReceiver implementation for settlement asset distribution.
The initialization creates a complete retail staking solution integrated with the protocol's institutional
flows.


```solidity
function initialize(
    address _owner,
    address _registryAddress,
    bool _paused,
    string memory _name,
    string memory _symbol,
    uint8 _decimals,
    address _asset,
    uint128 _maxTotalAssets,
    address _trustedForwarder
)
    external
    initializer;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_owner`|`address`|The address that will have administrative control over the vault|
|`_registryAddress`|`address`|The kRegistry contract address for protocol configuration integration|
|`_paused`|`bool`|Initial operational state (true = paused, false = active)|
|`_name`|`string`|ERC20 token name for the stkToken (e.g., "Staked kUSDC")|
|`_symbol`|`string`|ERC20 token symbol for the stkToken (e.g., "stkUSDC")|
|`_decimals`|`uint8`|Token decimals matching the underlying asset precision|
|`_asset`|`address`|Underlying asset address that this vault will generate yield on|
|`_maxTotalAssets`|`uint128`|The max TVL in underlying tokens|
|`_trustedForwarder`|`address`|The trusted forwarder for ERC2771 metatransactions|


### requestStake

Initiates kToken staking request for yield-generating stkToken shares in a batch processing system

This function begins the retail staking process by: (1) Validating user has sufficient kToken balance
and vault is not paused, (2) Creating a pending stake request with user-specified recipient and current
batch ID for fair settlement, (3) Transferring kTokens from user to vault while updating pending stake
tracking for accurate share calculations, (4) Coordinating with kAssetRouter to virtually move underlying
assets from DN vault to staking vault, enabling proper asset allocation across the protocol. The request
enters pending state until batch settlement, when the final share price is calculated based on vault
performance. Users must later call claimStakedShares() after settlement to receive their stkTokens at
the settled price. This two-phase approach ensures fair pricing for all users within a batch period.


```solidity
function requestStake(address _to, uint256 _amount) external payable returns (bytes32 _requestId);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_to`|`address`||
|`_amount`|`uint256`||

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_requestId`|`bytes32`|requestId Unique identifier for tracking this staking request through settlement and claiming|


### requestUnstake

Initiates stkToken unstaking request for kToken redemption plus accrued yield through batch processing

This function begins the retail unstaking process by: (1) Validating user has sufficient stkToken balance
and vault is operational, (2) Creating pending unstake request with current batch ID for settlement
coordination,
(3) Transferring stkTokens from user to vault contract to maintain stable share price during settlement period,
(4) Notifying kAssetRouter of share redemption request for proper accounting across vault network. The stkTokens
remain locked in the vault until settlement when they are burned and equivalent kTokens (including yield) are
made available. Users must later call claimUnstakedAssets() after settlement to receive their kTokens from
the batch receiver contract. This two-phase design ensures accurate yield calculations and prevents share
price manipulation during the settlement process.


```solidity
function requestUnstake(address _to, uint256 _stkTokenAmount) external payable returns (bytes32 _requestId);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_to`|`address`||
|`_stkTokenAmount`|`uint256`||

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_requestId`|`bytes32`|requestId Unique identifier for tracking this unstaking request through settlement and claiming|


### claimStakedShares

This function completes the staking process by distributing stkTokens to users after batch settlement.
Process: (1) Validates batch has been settled and share prices are finalized to ensure accurate distribution,
(2) Verifies request ownership and pending status to prevent unauthorized or duplicate claims, (3) Calculates
stkToken amount based on original kToken deposit and settled net share price (after fees), (4) Mints stkTokens
to specified recipient reflecting their proportional vault ownership, (5) Marks request as claimed to prevent
future reprocessing. The net share price accounts for management and performance fees, ensuring users receive
their accurate yield-adjusted position. stkTokens are ERC20-compatible shares that continue accruing yield
through share price appreciation until unstaking.


```solidity
function claimStakedShares(bytes32 _requestId) external payable;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_requestId`|`bytes32`||


### claimUnstakedAssets

Claims kTokens plus accrued yield from a settled unstaking batch through batch receiver distribution

This function completes the unstaking process by distributing redeemed assets to users after settlement.
Process: (1) Validates batch settlement and asset distribution readiness through batch receiver verification,
(2) Confirms request ownership and pending status to ensure authorized claiming, (3) Calculates kToken amount
based on original stkToken redemption and settled share price including yield, (4) Burns locked stkTokens
that were held during settlement period, (5) Triggers batch receiver to transfer calculated kTokens to
recipient,
(6) Marks request as claimed completing the unstaking cycle. The batch receiver pattern ensures asset isolation
between settlement periods while enabling efficient distribution. Users receive their original investment plus
proportional share of vault yields earned during their staking period.


```solidity
function claimUnstakedAssets(bytes32 _requestId) external payable;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_requestId`|`bytes32`||


### createNewBatch

Creates a new batch to begin aggregating user requests for the next settlement period

This function initializes a fresh batch period for collecting staking and unstaking requests. Process:
(1) Increments internal batch counter for unique identification, (2) Generates deterministic batch ID using
chain-specific parameters (vault address, batch number, chainid, timestamp, asset) for collision resistance,
(3) Initializes batch storage with open state enabling new request acceptance, (4) Updates vault's current
batch tracking for request routing. Only relayers can call this function as part of the automated settlement
schedule. The timing is typically coordinated with institutional settlement cycles to optimize capital
efficiency
across the protocol. Each batch remains open until explicitly closed by relayers or governance.


```solidity
function createNewBatch() external returns (bytes32);
```
**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`<none>`|`bytes32`|batchId Unique deterministic identifier for the newly created batch period|


### closeBatch

Closes a batch to prevent new requests and prepare for settlement processing

This function transitions a batch from open to closed state, finalizing the request set for settlement.
Process: (1) Validates batch exists and is currently open to prevent double-closing, (2) Marks batch as closed
preventing new stake/unstake requests from joining, (3) Optionally creates new batch for continued operations
if _create flag is true, enabling seamless transitions. Once closed, the batch awaits settlement by kAssetRouter
which will calculate final share prices and distribute yields. Only relayers can execute batch closure as part
of the coordinated settlement schedule across all protocol vaults. The timing typically aligns with DN vault
yield calculations to ensure accurate price discovery.


```solidity
function closeBatch(bytes32 _batchId, bool _create) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_batchId`|`bytes32`|The specific batch identifier to close (must be currently open)|
|`_create`|`bool`|Whether to immediately create a new batch after closing for continued operations|


### settleBatch

Marks a batch as settled after yield distribution and enables user claiming

This function finalizes batch settlement by recording final asset values and enabling claims. Process:
(1) Validates batch is closed and not already settled to prevent duplicate processing, (2) Snapshots both
gross and net share prices at settlement time for accurate reward calculations, (3) Marks batch as settled
enabling users to claim their staked shares or unstaked assets, (4) Completes the batch lifecycle allowing
reward distribution through the claiming mechanism. Only kAssetRouter can settle batches as it coordinates
yield calculations across DN vaults and manages cross-vault asset flows. Settlement triggers share price
finalization based on vault performance during the batch period.


```solidity
function settleBatch(bytes32 _batchId) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_batchId`|`bytes32`|The batch identifier to mark as settled (must be closed, not previously settled)|

### _createNewBatch

Internal function to create deterministic batch IDs with collision resistance

This function generates unique batch identifiers using multiple entropy sources for security. The ID
generation process: (1) Increments internal batch counter to ensure uniqueness within the vault, (2) Combines
vault address, batch number, chain ID, timestamp, and asset address for collision resistance, (3) Uses
optimized hashing function for gas efficiency, (4) Initializes batch storage with default state for new
requests. The deterministic approach enables consistent batch identification across different contexts while
the multiple entropy sources prevent prediction or collision attacks. Each batch starts in open state ready
to accept user requests until explicitly closed by relayers.

### setHardHurdleRate

Configures the hurdle rate fee calculation mechanism for performance fee determination

This function switches between soft and hard hurdle rate modes affecting performance fee calculations.
Hurdle Rate Modes: (1) Soft Hurdle (_isHard = false): Performance fees are charged on all profits when returns
exceed the hurdle rate threshold, providing simpler fee calculation while maintaining performance incentives,
(2) Hard Hurdle (_isHard = true): Performance fees are only charged on the excess return above the hurdle rate,
ensuring users keep the full hurdle rate return before any performance fees. The hurdle rate itself is set
globally in the registry per asset, providing consistent benchmarks across vaults. This mechanism ensures
vault operators are only rewarded for generating returns above market expectations, protecting user interests
while incentivizing superior performance.


```solidity
function setHardHurdleRate(bool _isHard) external;

### setPaused

Controls the vault's operational state for emergency situations and maintenance periods

This function provides critical safety controls for vault operations by: (1) Enabling emergency admins
to pause all user-facing operations during security incidents, market anomalies, or critical upgrades,
(2) Preventing new stake/unstake requests and claims while preserving existing vault state and user balances,
(3) Maintaining read-only access to vault data and view functions during pause periods for transparency,
(4) Allowing authorized emergency admins to resume operations once issues are resolved or maintenance completed.
When paused, all state-changing functions (requestStake, requestUnstake,
cancelUnstakeRequest,
claimStakedShares, claimUnstakedAssets) will revert with KSTAKINGVAULT_IS_PAUSED error. The pause mechanism
serves as a circuit breaker protecting user funds during unexpected events while maintaining protocol integrity.
