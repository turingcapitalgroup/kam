Foundation contract providing essential shared functionality and registry integration for all KAM protocol
contracts

This abstract contract serves as the architectural foundation for the entire KAM protocol, establishing
critical patterns and utilities that ensure consistency across all protocol components. Key responsibilities
include: (1) Registry integration through a singleton pattern that enables dynamic protocol configuration and
contract discovery, (2) Role-based access control validation that enforces protocol governance permissions,
(3) Emergency pause functionality for protocol-wide risk mitigation during critical events, (4) Asset rescue
mechanisms to recover stuck funds while protecting protocol assets, (5) Vault and asset validation to ensure
only registered components interact, (6) Batch processing coordination through ID management and receiver tracking.
The contract employs ERC-7201 namespaced storage to prevent storage collisions during upgrades and enable safe
inheritance patterns. All inheriting contracts (kMinter, kAssetRouter, etc.) leverage these utilities to maintain
protocol integrity, reduce code duplication, and ensure consistent security checks across the ecosystem. The
registry serves as the single source of truth for protocol configuration, making the system highly modular and
upgradeable.


## State Variables
### KBASE_STORAGE_LOCATION
ERC-7201 storage location calculated as: keccak256(abi.encode(uint256(keccak256("kam.storage.kBase")) - 1))
& ~bytes32(uint256(0xff))
This specific slot is chosen to avoid any possible collision with standard storage layouts while maintaining
deterministic addressing. The calculation ensures the storage location is unique to this namespace and won't
conflict with other inherited contracts or future upgrades. The 0xff mask ensures proper alignment.


```solidity
bytes32 private constant KBASE_STORAGE_LOCATION =
    0xe91688684975c4d7d54a65dd96da5d4dcbb54b8971c046d5351d3c111e43a800
```


## Functions
### _getBaseStorage

Returns the kBase storage pointer using ERC-7201 namespaced storage pattern


```solidity
function _getBaseStorage() internal pure returns (kBaseStorage storage $);
```
**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`$`|`kBaseStorage`|Storage pointer to the kBaseStorage struct at the designated storage location This function uses inline assembly to directly set the storage pointer to our namespaced location, ensuring efficient access to storage variables while maintaining upgrade safety. The pure modifier is used because we're only returning a storage pointer, not reading storage values.|


### __kBase_init

Initializes the base contract with registry integration and default operational state

This internal initialization function establishes the foundational connection between any inheriting
contract and the protocol's registry system. The initialization process: (1) Validates that initialization
hasn't occurred to prevent reinitialization attacks in proxy patterns, (2) Ensures registry address is valid
since the registry is critical for all protocol operations, (3) Sets the contract to unpaused state enabling
normal operations, (4) Marks initialization complete to prevent future calls. This function MUST be called
by all inheriting contracts during their initialization phase to establish proper protocol integration.
The internal visibility ensures only inheriting contracts can initialize, preventing external manipulation.


```solidity
function __kBase_init(address _registryAddress) internal;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_registryAddress`|`address`|The kRegistry contract address that serves as the protocol's configuration and discovery hub|


### setPaused

Toggles the emergency pause state affecting all protocol operations in this contract

This function provides critical risk management capability by allowing emergency admins to halt
contract operations during security incidents or market anomalies. The pause mechanism: (1) Affects all
state-changing operations in inheriting contracts that check _isPaused(), (2) Does not affect view/pure
functions ensuring protocol state remains readable, (3) Enables rapid response to potential exploits by
halting operations protocol-wide, (4) Requires emergency admin role ensuring only authorized governance
can trigger pauses. Inheriting contracts should check _isPaused() modifier in critical functions to
respect the pause state. The external visibility with role check prevents unauthorized pause manipulation.


```solidity
function setPaused(bool _paused) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_paused`|`bool`|The desired pause state (true = halt operations, false = resume normal operation)|


### rescueAssets

Rescues accidentally sent assets (ETH or ERC20 tokens) preventing permanent loss of funds

This function implements a critical safety mechanism for recovering tokens or ETH that become stuck
in the contract through user error or airdrops. The rescue process: (1) Validates admin authorization to
prevent unauthorized fund extraction, (2) Ensures recipient address is valid to prevent burning funds,
(3) For ETH rescue (_asset=address(0)): validates balance sufficiency and uses low-level call for transfer,
(4) For ERC20 rescue: critically checks the token is NOT a registered protocol asset (USDC, WBTC, etc.) to
protect user deposits and protocol integrity, then validates balance and uses SafeTransferLib for secure
transfer. The distinction between ETH and ERC20 handling accounts for their different transfer mechanisms.
Protocol assets are explicitly blocked from rescue to prevent admin abuse and maintain user trust.


```solidity
function rescueAssets(address _asset, address _to, uint256 _amount) external payable;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|

## Events
### Paused
Emitted when the emergency pause state is toggled for protocol-wide risk mitigation

This event signals a critical protocol state change that affects all inheriting contracts.
When paused=true, protocol operations are halted to prevent potential exploits or manage emergencies.
Only emergency admins can trigger this, providing rapid response capability during security incidents.


```solidity
event Paused(bool paused_);
```

**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`paused_`|`bool`|The new pause state (true = operations halted, false = normal operation)|

### RescuedAssets
Emitted when ERC20 tokens are rescued from the contract to prevent permanent loss

This rescue mechanism is restricted to non-protocol assets only - registered assets (USDC, WBTC, etc.)
cannot be rescued to protect user funds and maintain protocol integrity. Typically used to recover
accidentally sent tokens or airdrops. Only admin role can execute rescues as a security measure.


```solidity
event RescuedAssets(address indexed asset_, address indexed to_, uint256 amount_);
```

**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`asset_`|`address`|The ERC20 token address being rescued (must not be a registered protocol asset)|
|`to_`|`address`|The recipient address receiving the rescued tokens (cannot be zero address)|
|`amount_`|`uint256`|The quantity of tokens rescued (must not exceed contract balance)|

### RescuedETH
Emitted when native ETH is rescued from the contract to recover stuck funds

ETH rescue is separate from ERC20 rescue due to different transfer mechanisms. This prevents
ETH from being permanently locked if sent to the contract accidentally. Uses low-level call for
ETH transfer with proper success checking. Only admin role authorized for security.


```solidity
event RescuedETH(address indexed to_, uint256 amount_);
```

**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`to_`|`address`|The recipient address receiving the rescued ETH (cannot be zero address)|
|`amount_`|`uint256`|The quantity of ETH rescued in wei (must not exceed contract balance)|

## Structs
### kBaseStorage
Storage struct following ERC-7201 namespaced storage pattern to prevent collisions during upgrades.
This pattern ensures that storage layout remains consistent across proxy upgrades and prevents
accidental overwriting when contracts inherit from multiple base contracts. The namespace
"kam.storage.kBase" uniquely identifies this storage area within the contract's storage space.

**Note:**
storage-location: erc7201:kam.storage.kBase


```solidity
struct kBaseStorage {
    /// @dev Address of the kRegistry singleton that serves as the protocol's configuration hub
    address registry;
    /// @dev Initialization flag preventing multiple initialization calls (reentrancy protection)
    bool initialized;
    /// @dev Emergency pause state affecting all protocol operations in inheriting contracts
    bool paused;
}
```
