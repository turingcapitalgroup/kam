# KAM Protocol Interfaces

This document describes the interfaces that make up the KAM protocol. The protocol implements a dual-track institutional/retail system with batch processing, two-phase settlements, and virtual balance accounting.

## Core Protocol Interfaces

### IkMinter

The institutional gateway for minting and burning kTokens. Implements a push-pull model where institutions can deposit assets to mint kTokens 1:1, and request burns that are fulfilled through batch settlements.

**Core Operations**

- `mint(address asset, address to, uint256 amount)` - Creates new kTokens by accepting underlying asset deposits in a 1:1 ratio
- `requestBurn(address asset, address to, uint256 amount)` - Initiates burn process by escrowing kTokens and creating batch burn request
- `burn(bytes32 requestId)` - Executes burn for a request in a settled batch, burning kTokens and transferring assets

**Request Management**

- Generates unique request IDs using hash function with multiple entropy sources
- Maintains per-asset batch tracking with `currentBatchIds[asset]` and `assetBatchCounters[asset]`
- Supports request status tracking (PENDING, REDEEMED)
- Integrates with batch settlement system for asset distribution via BatchReceiver contracts
- Manages batch lifecycle: create, close, settle, and BatchReceiver deployment

**Additional Functions**
